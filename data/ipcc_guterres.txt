12:05
dear representatives of the media i've
12:07
seen many scientific reports in my time
12:10
but nothing like these
12:12
today's ipcc report is an atlas of human
12:15
suffering
12:16
and the damning indictment of failed
12:18
climate leadership
12:20
with fact upon fact this report reveals
12:23
how people on the planet are getting
12:25
clobbered by climate change
12:27
nearly half of humanity is living in the
12:30
danger zone now
12:32
many ecosystems are at the point of no
12:34
return now and checked carbon pollution
12:36
is forcing the world's most vulnerable
12:38
on a frog march to destruction now
12:41
the facts are undeniable
12:43
this abdication of leadership is
12:46
criminal
12:47
the world's biggest polluters are guilty
12:49
of arson on our only home
12:52
it is essentially to meet the goal of
12:54
limiting global temperature rise to 1.5
12:56
degrees
12:57
and science tells us that will require
12:59
the world to cut emissions by 45 by 2030
13:03
and achieve net zero emissions of
13:05
greenhouse gases by 2050
13:08
but according to current commitments
13:11
global emissions are set to increase
13:13
almost 14 percent over the current
13:16
decade
13:17
that spells catastrophe it will destroy
13:20
any chance of keeping 1.5 alive
13:23
today's report underscores two core
13:26
truths
13:27
first coal and other fossil fuels are
13:30
choking humanity
13:32
all g20 governments have agreed to stop
13:33
funding coal abroad
13:35
they must now urgently do the same at
13:37
home and dismantle their coal fleets
13:40
those in the private sector still
13:42
financing coal must be held to account
13:45
oil and gas giants and their
13:46
underwriters are also on notice
13:49
you cannot claim to be green while your
13:51
plans and projects undermine the 2015
13:53
net zero target
13:55
and ignore the major emission cuts that
13:57
must occur this decade
14:00
people see through the smoke screen
14:02
oecd countries must phase out coal by
14:05
2030 and all others by 2040.
14:08
the present global energy mix is broken
14:12
as current events make all too clear our
14:15
continued reliance on fossil fuels makes
14:17
the global economy and energy security
14:19
vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and
14:21
crises
14:23
instead of slowing down the
14:24
decarbonization of the global economy
14:26
now is the time to accelerate the energy
14:28
transition to a renewable energy future
14:32
fossil fuels are a dead end
14:34
for our planet
14:36
for humanity and yes for economies
14:39
a prompt well-managed transition to
14:41
renewables is the only best pathway to
14:43
energy security universal access and the
14:46
green jobs our world needs
14:48
i'm calling for developed countries
14:50
multilateral development banks private
14:52
finances and others to form coalitions
14:55
to help measure emerging economies and
14:58
the use of coal
14:59
these targeted mechanisms of support
15:01
would be over and above existing
15:03
sustainable development needs
15:05
the second core finding from this report
15:08
is slightly better news
15:10
investments in adaptation work
15:13
adaptation saves lives
15:15
as climate impacts worsen and they will
15:18
scaling up investments will be essential
15:20
for survival
15:22
adaptation and mitigation must be
15:24
pursued with equal force and urgency
15:27
that is why i've been pushing to get the
15:29
50 percent of all climate finance for
15:31
adaptation
15:32
the glasgow commitment on adaptation
15:34
funding
15:35
is not enough to meet the challenges
15:37
faced by nations on the front lines of
15:39
the climate crisis
15:41
i'm also pressing to remove the
15:43
obstacles that prevent small island
15:44
states and least developed countries
15:46
from getting the finance they
15:48
desperately need to save lives and
15:50
livelihoods
15:52
we need new eligibility systems to deal
15:54
with this new reality
15:56
delay means death
15:58
i take inspiration from all those on the
16:01
front lines of the climate battle
16:02
fighting back with solutions
16:05
all development banks multilateral
16:07
regional national know what needs to be
16:09
done
16:10
work with governments to design
16:12
pipelines of bankable adaptation
16:14
projects and help them find the funding
16:16
public and private
16:18
and every country must honor the glasgow
16:20
pledge to strengthen national climate
16:22
plans every year until they are aligned
16:25
with 1.5 degrees celsius
16:28
the g20 must lead the way our humanity
16:31
will pay an even more tragic price
16:33
i know people everywhere are anxious and
16:37
angry
16:38
i am too
16:39
now is the time to turn rage into action
16:42
every fraction of the degree matters
16:44
every voice can make a difference and
16:45
every second counts thank you
