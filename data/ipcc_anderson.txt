thank you so much and to you professor
24:12
husang li to you petri my colleague
24:15
of course abdullah moxie secretary of
24:17
ipcc and to the co-chairs dr debra
24:20
roberts and dr hans otto portner
24:23
and to the my amazing and formidable
24:25
ipcc scientific community and friends
24:28
greetings from nairobi we are in the
24:31
midst of united nations environment
24:33
assembly
24:34
which
24:35
gathers here to look at environmental
24:38
issues and this report comes
24:40
at a time of great turmoil when we need
24:43
strong multilateralism to promote peace
24:45
and healthy environment and the message
24:47
this report sends is clear
24:49
climate change isn't lurking around the
24:51
corner waiting to pounce it's already
24:54
already upon us raining down blows on
24:57
billions of people
24:59
we're seeing dangerous disruption across
25:01
the natural world
25:03
species are migrating in such more
25:05
livable conditions
25:06
in climate risk hot spots deaths from
25:09
floods droughts or storms were 15 times
25:13
higher than those in more resilient
25:15
countries over the last decade
25:17
this is climate injustice particularly
25:21
for indigenous people and local
25:24
communities
25:25
and all of this and more at only 1.1
25:28
degrees celsius of global warming
25:30
even if we limit global warming to 1.5
25:33
degrees celsius the blows will come
25:36
harder and faster
25:38
as things stand we're heading to closer
25:40
to three degrees celsius we are in an
25:43
emergency heading for a disaster
25:47
we can't keep taking these hits and
25:50
treating the wounds
25:51
soon those wounds would be too deep too
25:54
catastrophic to heal
25:56
we need to soften and slow the blows by
26:00
cutting greenhouse gas emissions but we
26:02
also need to cushion the blows by
26:05
picking up our efforts to adapt to
26:07
climate change which have been too weak
26:10
for too long
26:11
the best way to do this is to let nature
26:14
do the job it spends millions of years
26:17
perfecting absorbing and channeling rain
26:20
water and surging waves maintaining
26:23
biodiversity and balance in the soils so
26:26
that diverse plants can grow providing
26:29
cooling shade under leafy canopies
26:33
we need large-scale ecosystem
26:35
restoration from ocean to mountaintop
26:38
including through agreeing to start
26:40
negotiations on the global plastic
26:42
pollution agreement here in nairobi at
26:45
the fifth united nations environment
26:47
assembly we need to bring nature into
26:50
baking hot cities to keep them cool we
26:53
need to conserve mangroves coral reefs
26:56
and other nature's defenses we need to
26:59
protect and restore wetlands for nature
27:02
and incorporate wetlands into our cities
27:06
backing nature
27:07
is the best way to adapt to and to slow
27:11
climate change while providing jobs and
27:14
boosting economies
27:16
we must start dedicating thought and
27:18
funding to transformational adaptation
27:21
programs with nature at their heart
27:24
humanity has spent centuries treating
27:27
nature like its worst enemy
27:30
the truth is
27:32
that nature can be our savior
27:35
but only if we save it first thank you
